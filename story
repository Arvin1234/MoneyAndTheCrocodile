In the same forest there also lived a crocodile and his wife. Oned day the crocodile came to the banks of the river
and rested under the tree. The kind-hearted monkey offered him some fruits. The crocodile came back the next day for
more fruits as he loved them. As days passed by, the monkey and the crocodile became very good friends.
One day the monkey send some fruits for the crocodile's wife. She ate the fruits and liked them, but was jealous
as she didn't like her husband spending time with the monkey. She told her husband, "If the fruits are so juicy,
I wonder how sweet the monkey's heart would be. Get me the heart of the monkey". The crocodile was not willing to 
kill the monkey but had no choice.
